This is a tiny alien model (fun to play with), sporting some ripped sounds.

Little GREY alien invading bastard accidentally spatially displaced into a q2 deathmatch.

Installation: Create a directory called 'Grey' in your
//quake2/baseq2/players directory and just unzip the files
there.

Choose the player in the mulitplayer menu inside Quake2

Tools used: 3dsmax (model & animation)
q2modeler (compiling and skin base)
NST (Skin)and lots of linking unlinking and swearing



Possible future plans (if I have time ,which is pretty doubtful so dont let me hold anyone
out back from doing any of these suggestions and mailing them to me!)

*Viewable weapons pack
*Coloured elements on skin for ctf\teamplay
*Cyborg grey with strogg mech mangled skin (somebody else would do this better than me)
*Soundpack (suggest using xenoids sounds for time being,speeded up\reversed etc.)

Anyone interested in doing anything with this model,especially some skins(this ones a bit...
........grey) then do it! just send us a copy of whatever you do.

Cheers,
